# My Grab

This is my project built when I started learning flutter. The purpose of this project is simulating the process of booking a vehicle on an app.

## Things you should know about my project:
Flutter: 3.0.1

Framework: Getx

API:
- API to route: https://api.map4d.vn/
- API to show map: Google Map
- API to store data: from my friend, he hasn't published source code, so I can't show.

##Features:
1. Register & OTP screen:

I handled validators for all fields in register, if the input is wrong, it will show an error.
